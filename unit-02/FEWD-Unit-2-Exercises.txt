<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
  
    </body>
</html>

    3. Copy the lyrics for the Imagine song from https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/johnlennon/imagine.html and paste it after the <body> tag and before the closing </body> tag
    4. Add a main heading using the <h1> tag and the name of the song as the text
    5. Surround each verse of the song with a <p> tag
    6. View the html file in Chrome

    8. To fix this issue add a <br> tag to the end of each line as shown below

    9. Add a <br> tag to the end of each line and reload the page in Chrome

    11. Although no longer recommended add a width attribute to the <img> tag and give it a value of 300px. This will reduce the size of the image to 300px width
